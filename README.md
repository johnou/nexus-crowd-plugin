Nexus Crowd Plugin
==================

This plugin works with Nexus 2.1.2 and Crowd 2.5.0 and is not tested with other configurations.

The crowd integration is using the almost obsolete SOAP interface (REST is now preferred) and this will be removed in a future version of the crowd client library.

The aim of this project is to offer an integration between Nexus and Crowd that can be installed on Nexus 2.x and offers the same level of functionality than its Nexus 1.8 counter part.

There are some works that need to be done on the crowd part:
- moving to the REST api (instead of SOAP)
